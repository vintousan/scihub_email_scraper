# Info Scraper 
A crude code that extracts info from the downloaded first pages of research papers (from Scihub) using Beautiful Soup, a Python-based HTML and XML parser. 

Input: CSV files that lists DOIs
Output: Emails 

Note: It's crude because some info cannot be extracted, due to some protection/encryption.
