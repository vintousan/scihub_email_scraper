# Info Scraper 
A crude code that extracts info from the downloaded first pages of research papers (from Scihub) using Beautiful Soup, a Python-based HTML and XML parser. <br/>

Input: CSV files that lists DOIs<br/>
Output: Emails <br/>

Note: It's crude because some info cannot be extracted, due to some protection/encryption. <br/>
Another Note: This code is created to explore the capabilities of the Beautiful Soup library. <br/>
Credit: This code is inspired from scihub downloader by https://github.com/gadilashashank/Sci-Hub. Please heed their warnings on its usage.
